# matplotlib-challenge
This assignment proved to be a significant challenge for me as I definitely underestimated it. However, having overcome it I can say now
that my skills in matplotlib have improved, especially when it comes to making graphs. I've learned a lot about how data can warp itself if you're 
not careful with the way that it's sorted. I think I could've certainly cleaned up the code if given more time by using less variables, but at some 
point I do have to move on to the next coursework. I also feel this assignment has helped me when it comes to examinining dataframes using groupby. 
One thing I found especially difficult about this assignment was not having an answer key to look back on. However, I understand that this is more
similar to what it's like to work with data in real life to create summaries of data for a client or an employer.
